<h2 class="subheading">Conceptual Design</h2>
<p>
    During conceptualization stage we evaluate processes to assess its procedural possibility, financial viability and operational ease. According to these reflections, we develop an enhanced process scheme along with the process flow diagram and the heat and material balance for the facility. We lead these studies for various green field projects including ones involving scale-up from laboratory / pilot plant scale to commercial scale.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the fundamental facilities, we routinely conduct these activities for existing systems with respect to:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Increase in process throughput</li>
    <li>Product purity / yield enrichment</li>
    <li>Change in feed conditions</li>
    <li>Modifications in modes of operation</li>
    <li>Conversion from batch to continuous systems</li>
    <li>And various other plant considerations</li>
</ol>
